# Open-Information-Extraction
Project for the course of open information extraction.
Our goal is to use OIE techniques to create a knowledge graph.
We applied our system on a sports automotive domain. Clearly it can be extended to any other domain.
This is a java based OIE system.
It's composed by:

      1) Web Crawler 
      
      2) NPL Module
      
      3) Tuple Extractor
      
      4) Tuple Updater 
      
      5) GUI
